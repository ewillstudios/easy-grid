# Easy Grid
    This is not a framework! Easy Grid is a minimalistic grid system that provides the grid only
    and not a full framework. This was created by [Elijah Williams](http://www.ewillstudios.com)
    and for Elijah Williams, but anyone who wants to use this is free to use as you see fit.

## Responsive
    Easy Grid is created under the mobile first principle and is fully responsive and adjustible
    to fit your needs.
